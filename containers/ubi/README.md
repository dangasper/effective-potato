Users of this container can produce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) by following [question #14 "How do I find the UBI BOMs for images, runtimes, other?"](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/ubi-faq#ubi_details).

## [UBI](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi)
 
The [Universal Base Image](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index#con_characteristics-of-ubi-images_assembly_types-of-container-images) is a collection of [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/)-compliant, freely redistributable, container base operating system images. There are [several options](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/5ec53f50ef29fd35586d9a56) to choose from that vary in size, complexity, or that include language runtimes and packages. All of the packages in UBI come from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and are supported like [RHEL](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata) when run on a Red Hat supported platform like [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
